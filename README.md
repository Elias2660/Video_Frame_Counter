# Video Frame Counter

This project includes a Python script (`converter.py`) for counting the frames in video files (`.h264` and `.mp4` formats) within a specified directory and outputs the counts to a CSV file (`counts.csv`).

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.12 and pip are installed.
3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate Virtual Environment 
    - on Windows

    ```powershell
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    - on Unix of MacOS

    ```sh
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

5. Install required dependencies: 

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To count the frames in video files:

```sh
python make_counts.py --path <path_to_video_files>
```

This will generate a counts.csv file in the specified directory containing the filenames and their corresponding frame counts.

## Available Scripts

- Make Counts: Counts frames from video files and generates counts.csv.
  ```sh
  python make_counts.py --path <path_to_video_files>
  ```
- Optimized Counts: Quickly counts frames using video metadata.
  ```sh
  python optimized_make_counts.py --path <path_to_video_files>
  ```
- MP4 to H264 Converter: Converts .mp4 files to .h264 and counts frames.
  ```sh
  python mp4toh264.py --path <path_to_video_files>
  ```
- H264 to MP4 Converter: Converts .h264 files to .mp4 and counts frames.
  ```sh
  python h264tomp4.py --path <path_to_video_files>
  ```
